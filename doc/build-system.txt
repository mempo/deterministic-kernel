Build and RELEASE (distribute) system for use in mempo.

The build model here is related to:
https://github.com/rfree2/fossoffice/blob/master/task/aptmempo/repo-server/server.txt


We need users: 
BUILD   - kernelbuild: the user (must be called "kernelbuild" usually) who runs the build process
SIGN    - repomake: the user who has gpg keys for signing the deb of kernel [and possibly own repo)
UPLOAD  - reposend: the user who can upload files to file-server (e.g. to http server)

Life of a deb package:
foo.deb - sha=7777cccc deterministically build package - created by user BUILD
foo.deb - sha=7777cccc deterministically build package by other user (always same checksum)
foo.deb.sig   - the signature on orginal deb sha=7777cccc - by SIGN
~/repos/.../pool/f/foo.deb - the file sha=7777cccc that is prepared to be served as debian-repo - by SIGN
~/repost...manifest        - the manifest, including the new file 7777cccc and previous ones - by SIGN
/var/www/...pool/f/foo.deb - the file being served by file-server - copied there by UPLOAD
/var/www/...manifest       - the file being served by file-server - copied there by UPLOAD
/var/www/sign/foo.deb.sig  - uploaded by UPLOAD

/home/kernelbuild/build/foo.deb <- created by BUILD
/home/kernelbuild/publish/foo.deb <- copy by BUILD (this dir is chmod 755)
/home/kernelbuild/publish/sign/foo/ <- signed by SIGN (this dir is chgrp SIGN, chmod g+rwx)
/home/makerepo/repo-prepare/ <- SIGN created by reprepro
(srv) /var/www/repo/.. <- uploaded entire tree from repo-prepare/ by UPLOAD

chmod 755 /home/kernelbuild/publish/
chmod 755 /home/makerepo/repo-prepare/

/home/kernelbuild/deterministic-kernel/ <-- build happens here
/home/kernelbuild/build/ <-- symlink to build dir with *.deb
/home/kernelbuild/publish <-- symlink to place that should contain *.deb for publishing
/home/kernelbuild/publish/sign <-- this will be chowned so that SIGN user can create .deb.sig there

Actions:

1. build kernel with ./run.sh (or triggered by BOTBUILD) and copy results to public
2. sign to .deb.sig 
3. run reprepro to compile+sign the repository
4. upload the repository
5. upload the sig


Additional users:
BOTBUILD - observes github (or other source) and triggers the build process when new version
BOTSAY   - observes github (or other source) and announces new version to various systems
